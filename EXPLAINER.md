## Idea: similar actions should be on adjacent keys

UNIX keyboard shortcuts tend to have alphabetical mnemonics.

Consider these pairings:

- C-b (page up)
- C-f (page down)

And:

- C-p (previous)
- C-n (next)

I think editing would be more pleasant if keys with similar functions were adjacent to each other.

## Questions, answered

(it’s not an FAQ if nobody’s asked any questions)

### Why are cursor-movement shortcuts on the ring and middle fingers, but the screen-movement shortcuts are on the middle and index fingers?

Because I really didn’t want to have to move the C-w shortcut menu. Doing this also let me have C-s save the file right from normal mode.
